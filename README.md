# Black-Friday-Sales-Analysis

The project involved a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, which included data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), advanced visualizations, and statistical modeling. Here are the key takeaways:

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Missing values in `Product_Category_2` and `Product_Category_3` were filled with `0` to ensure completeness.
   - The `Stay_In_Current_City_Years` column was converted to numeric, treating "4+" as 4 for consistency.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - The purchase distribution revealed that most purchases are concentrated within a specific range, as visualized in histograms.
   - Age-wise and gender-wise analysis showed distinct purchasing patterns across demographics.
   - Correlation analysis highlighted relationships between numerical features, aiding feature selection for modeling.

3. **Advanced Visualizations**:
   - Interactive dashboards using Plotly provided insights into purchasing behavior by age group and gender.
   - Heatmaps illustrated correlations between numerical variables, identifying key drivers of purchase amounts.

4. **Statistical Modeling**:
   - A linear regression model was built to predict purchase amounts based on demographic and product-related features.
   - The model demonstrated the importance of features like product categories and demographic factors in influencing purchases.

5. **Key Insights**:
   - Customers aged 26â€“35 were significant contributors to purchases, with males generally spending more than females.
   - Product categories had varying impacts on purchase amounts, with some categories showing stronger correlations with higher spending.

This project showcased the end-to-end process of data analysis in Python, combining data preprocessing, visualization, and modeling to derive actionable insights.
